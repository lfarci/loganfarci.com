# Building Scalable Web Applications

Creating web applications that can handle growth is crucial for long-term success. This article covers key principles and patterns for building scalable applications.

## Core Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Keep your code organized by separating different responsibilities:
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components and user interactions
- **Business Logic**: Core application logic and rules
- **Data Layer**: Data access and persistence

### 2. Component-Based Architecture
Break your application into small, reusable components:
- Easier to test and maintain
- Better code reuse
- Clearer separation of responsibilities

### 3. Performance Optimization
Consider performance from the beginning:
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Efficient state management
- Optimized bundle sizes

## Common Patterns

### Container/Presenter Pattern
Separate components that manage state from those that only display data.

### Custom Hooks
Extract reusable logic into custom hooks for better code organization.

## Conclusion

Building scalable applications requires thoughtful planning and adherence to proven patterns. Start with these fundamentals and iterate as your application grows.
